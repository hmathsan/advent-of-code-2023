# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for this year Advent of Code challenges written in Rust. 

## Running the project

Each day of challenge is inside the folder `challenges` and the inputs 
provided for me by the AoC site for each day is inside the folder `input`.

Running the project will consume the inputs from the `input` folder.
Running the tests will consume the strings in each test, those strings
are the examples provided in the AoC challenge.

Firstly clone the project:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/hmathsan/advent-of-code-2023.git
> cd  advent-of-code-2023
```

Having [Rust and Cargo installed](https://www.rust-lang.org) run 
using the command:

```shell
> cargo run
```

And the tests:

```shell
> cargo test
```
