# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for this year Advent of Code challenges written in Rust. 

## Running the project

Each day of the challenge is separated in the `bin` folder so that each of them can be 
executed separately.

Firstly clone the project:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/hmathsan/advent-of-code-2023.git
> cd  advent-of-code-2023
```

Having [Rust and Cargo installed](https://www.rust-lang.org) run each challenge using
the command:

```shell
cargo run --bin day_one
```
